# Thailand Plan 
##  Bangkok (Start Point – City + Nightlife)

- First couple of days just chill in **Bangkok ** – river cruise on Chao Phraya, rooftop vibes.
    
- Daytime: Grand Palace, Wat Pho, temples, quick shopping runs.
    
- Nighttime: **Soi Cowboy / Nana Plaza** madness, some bar hopping, and one proper night out.
    
- Then Fly to South.
    

---

## Krabi (Adventure + Chill Mix)

- Base around Ao Nang – good balance of chill + some nightlife.
    
- Hit **Railay Beach** (limestone cliffs + caves, good views).
    
- Hot springs / treks nearby to get the explorer mode on.
    
- One full day for **island hopping** – Four Islands / Hong Islands – proper snorkeling, turquoise waters, the whole Instagram scene.
    
- Vibe here is more relaxed compared to Phuket
    

---

## Phi Phi Islands (Party Island)

- The classic SE Asia backpacker stop.
    
- **Maya Bay** for the turquoise postcard vibes.
    
- Sunset hike up to **Phi Phi Viewpoint** – everyone gathers up there with drinks.
    
- Night: Ibiza-style **pool parties + fire shows** on the beach, rave vibes till morning.
    
- Best for 1–2 nights – you don’t “rest” here, it’s party island energy.
    

---

## 🌊 Phuket (Big, Lively, Party + Beach Base)

- This is the **main party HQ** – Patong Beach & **Bangla Road** for nightlife that doesn’t stop.
    
- During the day – water sports, Freedom/Kata beach for a breather, maybe Tiger Kingdom if we’re feeling touristy.
    
- Sunset at **Promthep Cape** → legendary.
    
- Perfect 3-day base since you can do both **day trips** + all-out nights.
    

---

## Koh Phangan (Only if timings click)

- Nov 6th is a **Full Moon Party** – absolute chaos, thousands dancing on the beach, paint, EDM, fire shows.
    
- If we line this up → we should hop here before heading north.
    
- Otherwise, this island is still worth it for waterfalls, chill beaches, and random jungle parties.
    

---

## Koh Tao (Optional Add-on)

- If the group wants chill after chaos → Koh Tao is for diving, snorkeling, relaxed bars, and younger backpacker crowd.
    
- Small but super charming.
    

---

## Chiang Mai (Final Stop – Nov 7–8 Frisbee)

- Fly north for the frisbee tournament (main reason for being here).
    
- City itself is more laidback – coffee shops, night markets, temples.
    
- Chill nights with the boys to wrap up the madness.

**Bangkok → Krabi → Phi Phi → Phuket → (Koh Phangan if Full Moon) → Chiang Mai**

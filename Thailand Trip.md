# Overall Flow

#### **1. Phuket (Big, Lively, Party + Beach Mix)**

- **Patong Beach** → Nightlife hub, beach clubs, Bangla Road (crazy parties).

Good for a **3-day base** if you want both party + day trips.

---

#### **2. Phi Phi Islands (Iconic + Party Island)**

- **Maya Bay** → iconic turquoise water.
- **Phi Phi Viewpoint hike** → youth groups go up at sunset.
- **Fire shows + beach raves** → one of the most famous party scenes in SE Asia.

Ideal for 1–2 nights, especially if your group likes the backpacker, wild nightlife vibe.

---

#### **3. Krabi (Adventure + Chill + Instagram-worthy)**

- **Railay Beach** → stunning limestone cliffs + caves + chill vibes.
- **Ao Nang** → more nightlife (though more relaxed than Phuket/Phi Phi).

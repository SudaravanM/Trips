### Reddit Suggestions:
  
Here are my suggestions when it comes to planning¬†[where to go in Vietnam](https://tourteller.com/blog/?s=vietnam&utm_source=reddit_organic&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=vietnam_travel):¬†

Option 1: North + Central Vietnam (Culture, Nature & Relaxation)
- Day 1-3: Hanoi (Old Quarter, Hoan Kiem Lake, Ninh Binh day trip)
- Day 4-5: Ha Long Bay (Overnight cruise)
- Day 6-8: Hoi An (Ancient town, beach, cooking class)
- Day 9-10: Da Nang (Ba Na Hills, Marble Mountains, My Khe Beach)

Option 2: South + Central Vietnam (Food & Scenic Coastal Vibes)
- Day 1-3: Ho Chi Minh City (Ben Thanh Market, Cu Chi Tunnels, street food tour)
- Day 4: Mekong Delta (Day trip)
- Day 5-6: Da Nang (Golden Bridge, My Khe Beach)    
- Day 7-10: Hoi An (Relaxed sightseeing, basket boat tour, beach time)

Domestic flights in Vietnam are cheap and save you from long train/bus rides. Booking a private car for short transfers (e.g., Hue to Da Nang) can also make travel more comfortable for your family.

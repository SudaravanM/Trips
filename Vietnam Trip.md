### Reddit Suggestions:
  
Here are my suggestions when it comes to planning¬†[where to go in Vietnam](https://tourteller.com/blog/?s=vietnam&utm_source=reddit_organic&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=vietnam_travel):¬†

Option 1: North + Central Vietnam (Culture, Nature & Relaxation)
- Day 1-3: Hanoi (Old Quarter, Hoan Kiem Lake, Ninh Binh day trip)
- Day 4-5: Ha Long Bay (Overnight cruise)
- Day 6-8: Hoi An (Ancient town, beach, cooking class)
- Day 9-10: Da Nang (Ba Na Hills, Marble Mountains, My Khe Beach)

Option 2: South + Central Vietnam (Food & Scenic Coastal Vibes)
- Day 1-3: Ho Chi Minh City (Ben Thanh Market, Cu Chi Tunnels, street food tour)
- Day 4: Mekong Delta (Day trip)
- Day 5-6: Da Nang (Golden Bridge, My Khe Beach)    
- Day 7-10: Hoi An (Relaxed sightseeing, basket boat tour, beach time)

Domestic flights in Vietnam are cheap and save you from long train/bus rides. Booking a private car for short transfers (e.g., Hue to Da Nang) can also make travel more comfortable for your family.

## üáªüá≥ **Things To Do in Each City ‚Äì Vietnam Trip**
---

###  **Hanoi** (2.5 ‚Äì 3.5 days)

Our intro to Vietnam ‚Äî lively, chaotic in a good way, and full of amazing food.
**Things to do:**

* Walk around the **Old Quarter**, especially at night.
* Hanoi Train Street
* Chill at **Hoan Kiem Lake** and check out **Ngoc Son Temple**.
* Hit up **Beer Street (Ta Hien)** ‚Äî super fun vibes, packed with locals and tourists.
* Food is a big deal here: **Pho**, **Bun Cha**, **egg coffee** ‚Äî we‚Äôre going all in.
* Restaurant : The Note Cafe

### **Halong Bay** (1 full day)

This one‚Äôs a no-brainer.

* Book a **Halong Bay cruise** ‚Äî either a full day or overnight (overnight is more fun, includes kayaking, chill time, and sunset party vibes).
* It‚Äôs super scenic ‚Äî limestone cliffs, emerald water, all that good stuff.

### **Hue**

We‚Äôll fly or train here from Hanoi. It's a smaller, historic city ‚Äî quieter than the others but worth a quick stop.
**To do:**

* Explore the **Imperial City (Citadel)** ‚Äî kind of like stepping back in time.
* Visit **Thien Mu Pagoda**, maybe take a quick boat ride on the **Perfume River**.
* Good for photos and chill history time.

### **Da Nang**
Preferrable on a Friday so that, Dragon breathsüî•
1hr from Hoi An

More modern and relaxed. We won‚Äôt spend too long here, maybe half a day.
**Vibe:**

* Gorgeous, clean beaches ‚Äî great for a short swim or chill walk.
* Big expat and digital nomad scene.
* Tbh, **Dragon Bridge** is kind of overrated, but cool to see if we‚Äôre passing by.
* **Golden Hand Bridge** at Ba Na Hills is Instagram-famous but touristy. Optional stop if we‚Äôre into it.
* Motor Bike Tour (?)
* Marble Mountains

### **Hoi An** (Highly recommended ‚Äì 1 to 2 days)

This one‚Äôs a gem. Super cute, colorful, romantic ‚Äî even for a group trip, it's great.
**Things we should do:**
* Explore the **Ancient Town** (especially magical at night with lanterns everywhere).
* Take a **basket boat ride** or go through the coconut forest.
* Hop between caf√©s ‚Äî it has a nice chill vibe.
* Stay Option : Cheerful Hoi An Hostel (Free cycle and free tour guide)

* Coffee making class
* Optional: stay the night or do a long day trip from Da Nang. Up to us, but ideally we give it 1‚Äì2 days.
* Lang Co Beach
* Restaurant : UU Dam Chay Vegan (üü©)
* Dishes : Banh Can, Xi-Ma (pronounced as "seema"), Cao Lau
* Stay : Preferable in Ancient Old town than near beach

>  Total time for **Hoi An + Da Nang**: \~2.5 days

### **Nha Trang** (Optional ‚Äì Russian Town)

If we‚Äôre up for it, we can take an **overnight train from HCMC** (\~9 hrs, around ‚Çπ2100).

* Super chill beach town.
* An Bang Beach
* Mostly just relax, maybe try **scuba diving** or a spa day.
* Not mandatory, but an option if we‚Äôre ahead of schedule or want to extend the trip.
* Restaurants : Greek Souvlaki Nha Trang, La Cala - Gusto Italiano
* Stay : Aaron Hotel (Expensive)

Nha Trang ‚úàÔ∏è Da Nang üõª Hoi An

### **Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC)** (~2 days)

Faster-paced, more modern ‚Äî kind of like a mix of Hanoi‚Äôs buzz with Da Nang‚Äôs vibe.

* Chill at a rooftop caf√© or bar ‚Äî some cool views here.
* Landmark 81
* Restruant: Bhan Mi (Huynh Hoa)
* Stay: Somewhere between District 1 between District 4
* Nightlife? **Bui Vien Street** is wild ‚Äî music, bars, and chaos in a fun way.
* Optional: **Cu Chi Tunnels** ‚Äî depends on interest, but could be a cool half-day thing. Check via [Gadt Travel](https://gadttravel.com). Very famous but 8 hrs by drive from HCMC.

### **Mekong Delta** (Day Trip)

We‚Äôll probably do this as a day trip from HCMC.

* Chill river rides, coconut candy, floating markets.
* Slower pace, scenic, good for one relaxing day before flying out.
